#Linuxcommands ⭐️

## Terms

* Kernel: **Core** of any OS! Acts as mediater btw Apps and H/W(CPU, Memory, Device)  
* Shell: Command Line Interpreter  
* BASH: The default shell for most Linux systems
* Daemons: Service(program) that provides several functions that may not be available on the base OS.
    - main task: listen to service request, then acts the request.
    - runs in the background, free of user control  
    - after the request is serviced, the Daemon disconnects and waits for further requests.  
    - **has no controlling terminal. Process를 보면 TTY에 ?가 나옴** = 유저가 아니라 OS가 시작했다는 뜻  
    - 대부분 'd'로 끝남  
    - Process vs. Daemon을 잘 알아둘 것
        - OS가 시작할때 자동으로 시작하고...  
        - 서비스이고  
        - 컨트롤 할 수 있는 터미널이 없고, 역할은, 등등...  
* LILO: Linux Loader  
    - Boot loader. Loads the Linux OS into main memory so that it can begin its operations  
    - /etc/lilo.conf  

## Frequent Questions
* What is the advantages of Linux being open-source?  
-> Serveral Distributions are available. (e.g. Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian)
-> Security experts can help the security
-> OS is free, but enterprise support may not be free  
  
* Basic components of Linux OS?
**-> Kernel, Shells & GUI (System Libraries) & System Utilities**
-> Kernel interacts directly with the underlying hardware, and provides required abstraction to hide low level h/w detials to the system or app programs  
  
* How to check Memory stats and CPU stats as a Linux admin?  
->**free & vmstat** commands to see the phy. and vir. memory statistics respectively  
```
free -m  
free -g  
vmstat -a
vmstat 2 6 (happens every 2 seconds, for 6 intervals)
vmstat -t 1 5 (adds time)
```
-> **sar** CPU utilization & other stats  
System Activity Report
```
sar -u 
```

* How to shrink size of **LVM partition**? (Logical Volumn)  
-> perform these actions in order:
```
df -hT
umoung /lvm
e2fsck -f /dev/zoom/linux
resize2fs /dev/zoom/linux 3G
lvreduce -L 3GB /dev/zoom/linux
mount /dev/zoom/linux /lvm
df -hT
```

* Explain the functionality of root user
-> superuser or system administrator
-> default account every time Linux is installed
-> Access, execute

* CLI? GUI?
-> Command Line Interface
advantage: multiple steps can be executed by a single command
-> Graphic User Interface

* How can you find out how much memory Linux is using?
```
free -g
```
OR
```
cat /proc/meminfo
```
  
  
* What is **Swap space**?
-> temporary space to hold active programs
-> 메모리가 부족하면 main memory에서 이 swap space를 비움

* What is the typical size of a Swap partition under Linux system?
-> 2 x the amount of physical memory

* How to access partitions under Linux
```
fdisk -l
```

* How are hard drives and floppy drives referred in Linux filesystem?
-> floppy drives **/dev/fd0** and **/dev/fd1**
-> IDE/EIDE hard drives **/dev/hda, /dev/hdb, /dev/hdc**
  
* How are names assigned to the different serial ports?
**/dev/ttyS0 /dev/ttyS7** 
  
* How are parallel ports (printers) referenced in Linux?
ls -l /dev/lp*
  
* What are the kind of permissions available in Linux?
