Github

-   기본 사용법: <https://milooy.wordpress.com/2017/06/21/working-together-with-github-tutorial/>

-   Confusing terms

    -   HEAD: 나의 repo가 현재 가리키고 있는 commit. 대부분 최신 commit을 가리킴.

    -   master: "the main branch". 로컬 master branch는 대부분 origin의 remote repo를 따라간다.

    -   origin: main remote repo.

-   Rebase
